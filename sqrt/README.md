# Square root operation 
Input: bfloat16

Output: bfloat16

bfloat16_sqrt_input.txt is the truth table for every possible input value of a bfloat16 number (16-bits), and the corresponding output bfloat16 number (16-bits).

bfloat16_sqrt_input.txt is the minimised logic circuit output from the ESPRESSO logic minimizer.

bfloat16_sqrt is verilog code generated using the espresso2verilog python script, the minised logic circuit from ESPRESSO is provided as input to the python script.
